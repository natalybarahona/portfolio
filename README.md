Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! Here, I showcase projects where I transform raw data into actionable insights using:

📊 SQL: Querying and managing relational databases for efficient data extraction.

🐍 Python: Cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

📈 Excel/Google Sheets: Advanced formulas, pivot tables, and dashboards for quick analysis.

📉 Tableau/Power BI: Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.

📑 LaTeX: Professional documentation and reproducible reports.

Each project demonstrates my ability to collect, clean, analyze, and present data—bridging the gap between numbers and strategic decisions.
